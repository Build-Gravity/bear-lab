Always use strict typing. If you are presented with linter errors that are due to the library lacking type hints, add #type ignore
Add comments, but keep them succinct.
Remember to implement tests before their corresponding functionality. Keep tests simple but try to make them comprehensive.
Try to find files by listing the items rather than assume.
Refer to README.md in the root folder for directory information. 
Try to solve things in the simplest way possible; avoid creating unnecessary code or changes.
